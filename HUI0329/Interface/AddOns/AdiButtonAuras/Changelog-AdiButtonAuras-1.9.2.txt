Tagging version 1.9.2


--------------------

Rainrider:
	- bump config toc
	Fixes https://github.com/Adirelle/AdiButtonAuras/issues/178
	- priest: fix Archangel/Evangelism rule
	Fixes https://github.com/Adirelle/AdiButtonAuras/issues/177
	This was broken since
	https://github.com/Adirelle/AdiButtonAuras/commit/2d28ce8916ec685f57d40c17c5ac2a33ce12c7d4
	It broke because not passing a highlight to `BuildAuraHandler_Single`
	results in `model.count` and `model.expiration` not being set.
	- deathknight: add a rule for Plague Leech
	- bump toc
	- deathknight: show Frost Fever and Blood Plague on Outbreak
	The rule displays a counter if both diseases are found on the enemy and
	a timer for the one with the shorter duration.
	- druid: Omen of Clarity is now Restoration only
	- druid: Omen of Clarity only modifies Regrowth now
	This is now handled by LibPlayerSpells
